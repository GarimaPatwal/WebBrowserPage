#WebBrowserPage Using C# 

#Introduction
This project is a simple web browser built using C# Windows Forms.
It enables users to send HTTP requests, view raw HTML responses, manage browsing history, handle bookmarks, and navigate using basic browser controls.

The browser also displays HTTP status codes and identifies the first five hyperlinks on any webpage.
Persistent data storage is implemented using SQLite (for bookmarks) and text files (for history).
